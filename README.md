# H-bridge-motor-
I connect the H brige to the Ardiuno, then connect the DC mototrs and by using special code in the C++ language we can control the motor direction and speed. I write the code to control the motors movment forward and backward. Also by the code I control the speed first at 200 N after that accelerate the speed from zero to maximum and then decelerate the speed to zero.
